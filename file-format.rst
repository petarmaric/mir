MIR file format
===============

MIR is backed up by the `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/>`_ data file
format.

HDF5 is an extensible and open standard, comprised of platform independent
technologies which are available under Open Source licenses. HDF5 format has
been designed with the objective of creating data storages that are
self-descriptive, flexible, and have extremely fast and efficient access
patterns to the stored data.

.. note::

    Although not mandatory, MIR data files should have the ``.mir`` extension
    (lowercase), for easier identification on the file system.
