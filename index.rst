Mesh Intermediary Representation (MIR)
======================================

The Mesh Intermediary Representation (MIR) specification is an open standard
describing a platform-neutral data format for long-term storage and interchange
of mesh-like data.

It has also been designed to serve as an intermediary step when converting the
mesh-like data between different computational mechanics application formats.

You can read the MIR specification `online`_, or download a `printable PDF`_.
